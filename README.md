# Heart Disease Risk Analysis :-
-------------------------------

Project Overview:-
This project explores key health indicators to assess the likelihood of heart disease, 
using data analysis techniques in Microsoft Excel. It demonstrates how even a non-programmatic 
approach can yield powerful insights into risk factors like sugar level, heart rate, and 
cholesterol levels.

Objective:-
- Analyze health metrics to uncover correlations with high heart disease risk
- Identify thresholds and patterns that indicate elevated danger
- Present findings through an interactive Excel dashboard
- Raise awareness of lifestyle-related risk factors

Tools & Techniques Used:-
- Excel Formulas (IF, AND, OR, AVERAGE, COUNTIF, etc.)
- Pivot Tables and Slicers
- Conditional Formatting (to highlight high-risk individuals)
- Charting (Line, Bar, and Scatter plots)
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  
Features of the Dashboard:-
- Risk Categorization based on user’s vitals
- Trends in cholesterol, sugar levels, and heart rate
- Time-series analysis (if temporal data is used)
- Visual Risk Mapping using color-coded indicators

Key Metrics Analyzed:-
- Sugar Level — Indicator of diabetes-related stress on the heart
- Heart Rate — Assesses overall cardiovascular health
- Cholesterol Level — Gauges arterial health and risk of blockage
- Blood Pressure (if included) — Highlights patterns of hypertension
- Age & Gender — Provides demographic context for risk stratification
